# Jarvis

Personal assistant server: Hono + better-sqlite3 + croner + zod, TypeScript on Node 22.

## Layout

- `src/config.ts` reads `.env`, validates it with zod. Secrets are never logged.
- `src/db.ts` SQLite at `data/jarvis.db`: `jobs`, `runs`, `api_usage`.
- `src/runner.ts` `registerJob(name, cron, handler)`. Every run is recorded in `runs`
  (status, duration, captured log). A failing job never crashes the server.
- `src/jobs/` job definitions. `heartbeat` runs every 5 minutes.
- `src/app.ts` routes. `src/server.ts` entry point, binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` only.
- `launchd/` service plist, `cloudflared/` tunnel notes.

## Setup

```
cp .env.example .env        # then set WEBHOOK_SECRET (openssl rand -hex 32)
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Routes

| Route | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | none | `{"ok":true}` |
| `GET /` | none | jobs and the 20 latest runs (no logs shown) |
| `POST /webhook/:name` | `Authorization: Bearer <WEBHOOK_SECRET>` | runs job `:name` now. 401 bad/missing secret, 404 unknown job, 202 started |

The secret is compared in constant time. The auth check happens before the job lookup.

## Adding a job

```ts
import { registerJob } from "../runner";
registerJob("my-job", "0 9 * * *", async ({ log }) => { log("hello"); });
```

Call it from `src/server.ts`, rebuild, restart.

## Running as a service

`launchd/com.jarvis.server.plist` runs `node dist/server.js` with `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive`
(currently installed as a LaunchDaemon). After `npm run build`, restart by stopping the
process (launchd relaunches it), or `sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.jarvis.server`.
Logs go to `logs/`. The Cloudflare tunnel runs separately as `com.cloudflare.cloudflared`
and maps the public hostname to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Notes

`GET /` is public when the tunnel is up. Put it behind Cloudflare Access or add auth
before showing anything sensitive on it.
